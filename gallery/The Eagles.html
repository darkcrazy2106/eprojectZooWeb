    <h1>Description</h1>
    <div class="a">
        Eagles have many different identifying characteristics among eagle species, but the highlight is the color and
        size of each species. The largest eagle has a body length of more than 1 m and weighs 7 kg. The smallest species
        is only 0.4 m long and weighs more than 0.5 kg. Females are usually larger than males and about 25% heavier than
        males.<p></p>

        <div class="a">According to some unproven documents , eagles have a wingspan of more than 3 m and weigh up to 30
            kg. In
            fact, the eagle is smaller than that. Their wingspan is only 1.5 m to 2 m long.<p></p>
        </div>

        <div class="a">Eagles often nest in mountains or tall trees. Their nest is very large and every year they bring
            back new
            branches to make the nest stronger than before. The nest is where the female bird lays her eggs. Each
            spawning
            period, the female bird gives birth to 2 eggs. Since the parent bird is only capable of raising one young,
            there
            will often be a duel between the two chicks. The one that wins will be raised until adulthood. <p></p>

    <div class="a">
        In ancient Sumerian mythology, the mythical king Etana was said to have been carried into heaven by an
        eagle. Classical writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly
        at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the
        nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.<p></p>

        <div class="a">The eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the
        form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus
        bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology)
        page.<p></p></div>

        <div class="a">Psalm 103 (in Greek, Latin, and English) mentions renewing one's youth "as the eagle" (although the Hebrew word
        נשר apparently means vulture). Augustine of Hippo gives a curious explanation of this in his commentary on the
        Psalms.<p></p></div>

        <div class="a">An eagle is a common form in the Anglican tradition, often used to support the Bible because of the symbolism of
        spreading the gospel over the world. Additional symbolic meanings for "eagle" include the pronouncements to the
        Israelites in Exodus 19:4; Psalms 103:5 and Isaiah 40:31. The United States eagle feather law stipulates that
        only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally
        authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual reasons. In Canada, the poaching of eagle
        feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the
        crime.</div><p></p>

        <div class="a">The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art.</div>
