    <h1>Evolution</h1>
    <div class="a">
        Dolphins, like whales, are descendants of terrestrial mammals , and may all belong to the phylum Artiodactyl .
        The
        ancestors of today's modern dolphins may have entered the water about 50 million years ago during the Eocene
        epoch .<p></p>
        <div class="a">Modern dolphin bones have two small , rod-shaped pelvises and are given atrophied hind legs.
            October 2006, a
            strange bottlenose dolphin was caught in Japan; This fish has 2 small fins on either side of the genital
            slit
            and is determined by scientists to have developed hind legs.</div>
    </div>
    <h2>Senses</h2>
    <div class="a">Most dolphins have keen eyesight both in their lips and in the water and can perceive frequencies 10
        times higher than humans can hear. Although dolphins have small ears on either side of their heads, it is
        thought that in aquatic environments, fish hear with their lower jaws and conduct sound to the middle ear
        through openings in the jawbone. Hearing is also used to broadcast biological radar, an ability all dolphins
        have. It is thought that dolphin teeth are used as receptors, they receive incoming sounds and indicate the
        exact position of the subject. Dolphin's sense of touch is also well-developed, with nerve endings densely
        distributed over the skin , especially in the nose ., pectoral fins and genital area. However, dolphins do not
        have smell receptors and are therefore believed to have no sense of smell . Dolphins also have taste buds
        and show a preference for certain fish foods. Dolphins spend most of their time underwater, sensing the taste of
        water can help dolphins smell in the same way that taste can tell fish the presence of objects beyond their
        mouth.<p></p>

        <div class="a">Although dolphins have no hair, they still have hair follicles that help perform some tactile
            functions. It
            is believed that the tiny hairs on the beak of the Boto river dolphin act as a tactile system to compensate
            for
            the species' poor eyesight .</div>
