    <h1>Classification</h1>
    <div class="a">
        The scientific taxonomy of elephantids includes a rich record of fossil specimens, spanning millions of years,
        some of which persist until the end of the last ice age. Recently several species have become extinct. The
        discovery of new specimens and the proposed cladistics method has led to systematic revisions of them and
        related Proboscideans .<p></p>

        <div class="a">Elephants are informally classified as the family of elephants , or in paleontological contexts
            as elephants and
            mammoths. The common name elephant refers primarily to the extant taxon, the present elephant species, but
            may
            also refer to many extinct species, both within this and others. Other members of the family Elephantidae,
            especially members of the genus Mammuthus , are commonly known as mammoths .<p></p>
        </div>

        <div class="a">The families branched off from a common ancestor of mastodons in the family Mammutidae . The
            classification is
            unstable and frequently revised.<p></p>

    <H2>Evolutionary history</H2>
    <div class="a">
        Although the fossil evidence is uncertain, through a comparison of genes, scientists have discovered evidence
        that elephants and other Proboscideans share a common ancestor. distant from Sirenia (sea cow) and Hyracoidea
        (Demand). Along with the cetaceans ( Desmostylia ) and the order Embrithopoda they are thought to be extinct,
        belonging to the order Paenungulata ( Paenungulata).). In the ancient past, members of the various Daman
        families grew to large sizes, and the common ancestor of all three families is now thought to be an amphibious
        Daman. One theory is that these animals spent most of their time in the water, using their trunks as snorkels to
        breathe. Modern elephants have this ability and are known to swim that way for periods of up to six hours and
        distances of about 50 kilometers (31 miles). In the past, many species and genera have been discovered,
        including mammoths and pygmy elephants .
