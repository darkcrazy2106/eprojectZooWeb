    <div class="a">
        Peacocks are omnivores and eat mainly plants, petals, seed heads, insects and other arthropods , reptiles and
        amphibians . Wild peacocks forage by raking the leaves early in the morning or at dusk. They retreat into the
        shade and safety of the woods during the hottest part of the day. Peacocks are not picky eaters, will eat almost
        anything they can fit into their beaks and digest. Birds actively hunt insects such as ants, crickets and
        termites; rolling mat; arthropods and other small mammals.  Indian peacocks also eat small snakes.<p></p>

        <div class="a">Domesticated peacocks may also eat bread and loose grains such as oats and corn, cheese, cooked rice and
        sometimes cat food. Breeders have found that peacocks prefer high-protein foods including barn -destroying
        larvae , various meats and fruits, as well as vegetables including dark leafy greens, broccoli, carrots, and
        beans , beets and peas.<p></p></div>
