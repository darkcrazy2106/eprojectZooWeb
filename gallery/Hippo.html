    <H1>Overview </H1>
    <div class="a">
        Hippos are semi-aquatic, semi-terrestrial, inhabiting the rivers , lakes and mangrove swamps of West Africa
        where males dominate a stretch of river and lead herds of 5 to 30 females and calves. young. During the day,
        they maintain their cool by soaking in water or mud; and spawning also takes place in water. They come ashore at
        night to eat grass. Although hippos rest close together in the water, foraging is a solitary and non-territorial
        activity.<p></p>

        <div class="a">Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial ungulates, they are most closely
            related to
            whales and dolphins , which diverged about 55 million years ago. The common ancestor of whales and hippos
            diverged from other even-toed ungulates about 60 million years ago. The earliest known hippo fossils belong
            to the African genus Kenyapotamus , dating to about 16 million years ago.<p></p>
        </div>

        <div class="a">Hippos are recognized by their round, almost hairless body, large mouth and jaws, short legs, and
            large size.
            They are the third largest land mammal in terms of weight (1½ to 3 tons), after the white rhinoceros (1½ to
            3½
            tons) and three species of elephants (3 to 9 tons), 3.6–4 m long, tall from 1.5-1.7m. Hippos are one of the
            largest four-legged animals . Despite having short legs and a stocky build, they can easily run faster than
            humans. They have been recorded at speeds of 30 km/h (19 mph) over short distances. Hippos are one of the
            most
            aggressive creatures in the world and are often considered one of the most dangerous animals in Africa.
            There
            are currently an estimated 125,000 to 150,000 hippos throughout sub-Saharan Africa ; Zambia (40,000) and
            Tanzania (20,000–30,000) are the two countries with the largest hippo populations. They are still threatened
            by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory fangs .<p></p>

    <H2> Attacks on humans </H2>
    <div class="a">
        Hippos are one of the most aggressive creatures in the world and are often seen as one of the most dangerous
        animals in Africa as well as in the world. No wild animal in Africa kills more people than hippos. Every
        year 2900 people are killed by this species. Hippos are especially aggressive when it comes to trespassing
        their territory and touching their offspring. That is why it is very easy for the aborigines in Africa to lose
        their lives when they accidentally invade the territory of the hippo. They will chase them, drag them into the
        lagoon, bite their boats and possibly bite their heads off.<p></p>

        <div class="a">As Africa's fiercest animal, the hippo's jaws can crush one or two crocodiles about three meters long. Their
        ferocity is stronger than any large animal. They have an average weight of up to 1.5 tons and their teeth have
        the strength of a large sledgehammer. They often attack humans and small ships. Despite its short body and
        four short legs, hippos can reach speeds of up to 48 km/h and easily surpass humans. They are also the third
        heaviest terrestrial mammal. Males can weigh up to 1.8 tons and be about 5 meters long. Don't tease a hippo,
        especially when it's eating lunch .<p></p></div>
        <div class="a">Even hippopotamuses that are raised and bonded from a young age can kill their owners, as exemplified by the
        tragedy of a South African farmer when his 6-year-old pet loved and take care of the dead by evisceration until
        death. Marius's mutilated body was discovered floating in a river running through his farm in rural South Africa
        after which the hippo ran wild across the grasslands to attack the players. golfing at a club near the farm
        and biting to death a calf of his boss's business partner.<p></p></div>
