    <h1> External and anatomical features </h1>
    <div class="a">
        Fully adult giraffes are 4.3–5.7 m (14.1–18.7 ft) tall, with males being taller than females. The tallest
        recorded male was 5.88 m (19.3 ft) and the tallest recorded female was 5.17 m (17.0 ft). Mean weight was 1,192
        kg (2,628 lb) for adult males and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for adult females [48] with maximum weights of 1,930 kg
        (4,250 lb) and 1,180 kg (2,600 lb) respectively. were recorded for men and women, respectively. Despite having
        long necks and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short. [49]: 66 Located on the sides of the head, the
        giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it a full view from its great height. Giraffes see in color [50]:26 and their
        senses of hearing and smell are also very keen. The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect it from
        sandstorms and ants. The giraffe's primitive tongue was about 45 cm (18 in) long. It is purplish-black in color,
        presumably to protect against sunburn, and is useful for grabbing foliage, as well as combing and cleaning
        animals' noses. A giraffe's upper lip is also an anterior lip and is useful when feeding, and is covered with
        hair to protect it from thorns. The tongue and the inside of the mouth are covered with papillae. The plumage
        has dark spots or patches (may be orange, chestnut, brown, or almost black) separated by light coats (usually
        white or cream. Male giraffes become darker in color. As they age, feathers have been found to camouflage
        themselves in the light and shade of steppe forests.When standing among trees and bushes, they are barely
        visible from several meters away. However, adult giraffes move to get the best view of an approaching predator,
        based on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than camouflage, which may be more important for
        calves. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern. Giraffes inherit some coat pattern traits from their
        mothers, and variation in some traits is correlated at some point with neonatal survival rates. The skin
        underneath the bruises can act as a thermoregulatory window, the site of a complex vascular system and major
        sweat glands.<p></p>

        <div class="a">The skin of the giraffe is mainly gray, or tanned. Its thickness allows the animal to run through
            the thorns
            without being punctured. The coat can serve as a chemical defense, as its parasite repellant gives the
            animal a
            distinctive scent. At least 11 major aromatic chemicals are present in feathers, although indole and
            3-methylindole are responsible for most of the odor. Because males have a stronger odor than females, this
            smell
            can also have a sexual function. Along the neck of the animal is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one
            meter (3.3 ft) long tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.

    <h2>Habits and ecosystems</h2>
    <div class="a">
        Giraffes usually live in savannas and open forests. They prefer the Acacieae , Commiphora , Combretum and
        Terminalia open forests to denser environments such as Brachystegia . Angola giraffes can be found in desert
        environments. Giraffes forage on tree branches, preferring trees of the subfamily Acacieae and genera Commiphora
        and Terminalia,is an important source of calcium and protein to maintain the giraffe's growth rate. They also
        eat shrubs, grass, and fruit. A giraffe eats about 34 kg (75 lb) of leaves per day. When stressed, giraffes can
        chew on tree bark. Despite being herbivores, giraffes are known to visit carcasses and lick dried meat off
        bones. During the wet season, food is abundant and the giraffes spread out more, while in the dry season they
        congregate around the remaining evergreen trees and shrubs. Mothers tend to feed in open spaces, presumably to
        make predators easier to spot, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As ruminants, giraffes first
        chew their food, then swallow it for processing and then pass it through the clearly digested neck up to the
        neck and back to the mouth for chewing, to salivate during feeding. The giraffe needs less food than many other
        herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive
        system. Animal droppings come in the form of small pellets. When given access to water, giraffes drink no more
        than three days apart.<p></p>

        <div class="a">Giraffes have a huge effect on the trees they eat, delaying the growth of young trees for a
            number of years and
            giving "waistlines" to trees that are too tall. They eat most in the first and last hours of the day.
            Between
            these hours, giraffes mostly stand and chew. Rumination is the predominant activity at night, when lying
            down is
            predominant.</div>

    <h3> Status of exploitation and conservation </h3>
    <div class="a">
        In 2010, giraffes were rated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as Of Most Concern
        from a conservation perspective, but a 2016 review classified giraffes as Vulnerable. Giraffes have been
        eliminated from much of their historical range including Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. They may also
        have disappeared from Angola, Mali and Nigeria, but have been introduced to Rwanda and Swaziland. The Masai
        subspecies and the reticulated subspecies are endangered, and the Rothschild subspecies is threatened. The
        Nubian subspecies is critically endangered. In 1997, Jonathan Kingdon identified the Nubian giraffe as the most
        threatened of all giraffe species; As of 2018, it may number up to about 450 individuals. Private game reserves
        have contributed to the conservation of giraffe populations in southern Africa.<p></p>

        <div class="a">Giraffes are probably a popular target for hunters across Africa. Different parts of their body
            are used for
            different purposes. Their meat is used for food. The tail feathers are used as blowers, bracelets, necklaces
            and
            threads. Shields, sandals, and drums were made of leather, and the strings of the musical instruments were
            ribbed. Smoke from burning giraffe skins was used by doctors in Buganda to treat nosebleeds. The Humr of
            Kordofan consumed the drink Umm Nyolokh, made from the liver and bone marrow of giraffes. Richard Rudgley
            theorized that Umm Nyolokh might contain DMT. The drink is said to induce hallucinations of giraffes,
            believed
            to be giraffe ghosts, by Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began hunting them for sport. Habitat
            destruction also hurts giraffes: In the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing space has led to
            deforestation.
            Often, giraffes can coexist with livestock, as they do not directly compete with them. In 2017, severe
            drought
            in northern Kenya increased land stress and the killing of wildlife by herders, with giraffe populations
            particularly affected. The Giraffe Manor is a popular hotel in Nairobi that is also home to Rothschild
            giraffes.
            The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is
            protected
            by law. Unauthorized killing is punishable by imprisonment. The United Nations Convention on Migratory
            Species
            selected giraffes for protection in 2017. In 1999, an estimated 140,000 giraffes existed in the wild.<p>

        <div class="a">Aerial surveys are the most common method for tracking giraffe population trends in large
            landlocked tracts of
            African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to be indeterminate. get many giraffes. Ground survey
            methods
            are more accurate and can be used in conjunction with aerial surveys for accurate estimates of population
            size
            and trends.</div>
