    <div class="a">Monkeys are four-legged animals belonging to the class of mammals , the order primates . Monkeys have three major
    groups, namely New World monkeys , Old World monkeys , and Ape monkeys . There are about 264 species of monkeys.
    Some monkey-like species, such as chimpanzees or apes , are commonly referred to as monkeys in the common sense,
    although biologists do not classify them as monkeys. However, there is no single trait that all monkeys have that
    other species do not.</div>
