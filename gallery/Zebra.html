    <div class="a">
        Plains zebras are medium in size, with a muscular body and relatively short legs. Adult zebras are about 1.4
        meters tall at the shoulder, about 2.3 meters long, and weigh about 230 kilograms . Like other zebra species,
        they have dark black and white stripes and don't have any two individuals looking alike. Currently, it is
        recognized that they have three subspecies , plus two other extinct subspecies .<p></p>

        <div class="a">All have vertical stripes on the front part of the body, which tend to become horizontal on the
            back part of the
            body. The northern population has clearer and narrower stripes; Southern populations have a fluctuating but
            smaller number of stripes on the lower parts, legs and back of the body. The first described subspecies was
            Quagga , now extinct, with brown hindquarters. (Technically, since Quagga was first described as E. quagga ,
            the
            zoologically correct name for the most common form of the plains zebra is E. quagga burchelli . )</div>

    <div class="a">
        Plains zebras are highly social and usually form small family groups consisting of one male, one, two or
        several females and calves born recently. Groups are permanent, and group size tends to fluctuate with
        habitat : In food-poor areas, groups are smaller. Over time, families of plains zebras grouped together in
        large herds, possibly with other groups or with other herbivores , mainly wildebeest . They are the favorite
        prey of lions, cheetahs , hyenas , jackalsand crocodile. However, the stripes on the body of zebras are
        camouflage among the grasslands to help them escape from predators. And if cornered, zebras can fight back.
        There have been many times when the lions were kicked by the zebra and had to run away.<p></p>

        <div class="a">Unlike many other large African ungulates , the plains zebra favors (but does not necessarily
            require) short
            grass to graze on. As a result, their range is wider than that of many other species, even in woodland
            areas, and they are often the first herbivores to appear in new grassy areas. Only after they had gnawed and
            trampled long grasses did wildebeest and gazelles arrive. However, to protect themselves from predators,
            plains zebras rest overnight in open areas with good night vision. They eat a wide variety of grasses,
            preferring young and fresh grass when possible, but they also eat leaves and young twigs.</div>
